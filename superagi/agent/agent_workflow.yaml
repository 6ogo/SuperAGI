# Exceptions, validation and assumptions
# -------------------------
# All steps except the loop end and terminal step must have next
# tool step : if it is a tool step it must have tool, instruction and next
# loop step : if it is a loop step it must have next containing next_step and exit_step
#             if exit step is not provided it will be considered as terminal step and workflow will terminate once loop is completed
# condition step : if it is a condition step it must have next containing output and step
#                  if output is not provided it will be considered as terminal step and workflow will terminate once condition is completed
# wait step: if it is a wait step it must have duration and next
#            if next is not provided it will be considered as terminal step and workflow will terminate once wait is completed
# wait for permission step: if it is a wait for permission step it must have next, output can be only YES and NO as action console just support them
