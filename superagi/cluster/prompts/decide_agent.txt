Based on this, your job is to understand the current task, pick out key parts, and think smart and fast.
Explain why you are doing each action, create a plan, and mention any worries you might have.
Ensure agent is picked from the below tool list. The goal string should only contain the goal.
Also, assign instructions to the agent

Agents:
{agents}
